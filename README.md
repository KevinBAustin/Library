This is a program that allows its users to view and interact with a list of library books. Users can read in lists from a file, write the current list to a file, print the contents of the list to the screen, find all books by a given author, find information on all books by a given author, add a book to the list, and remove a book from the list.

The executable for this program is ./test .

For the most part, we didn't really have any issues with this one. We met up in person in the lab again, which I think made it easier for both of us.
